# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
A project to perform customer segmentation analysis using machine learning techniques.

# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis using machine learning techniques. By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to specific groups, improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes customer transaction data. [Link to Dataset] (if applicable).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for analysis and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models for future use.
- `dashboard/`: Interactive dashboard code.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, streamlit, plotly

### Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

Install the required libraries:

bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to see the analysis and modeling steps.

To run the interactive dashboard:

bash

Copy
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
Project Steps
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Load and clean the data.

Handle missing values and normalize numerical features.

Save the cleaned data for further analysis.

Feature Engineering

Create new features to enhance the dataset.

Save the engineered features for modeling.

Model Training and Evaluation

Train a K-Means clustering model.

Save the clustered data for visualization and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA to understand data distribution and relationships.

Use visualizations like pair plots, correlation matrices, and t-SNE plots.

Interactive Dashboard

Build an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to explore customer segments.
